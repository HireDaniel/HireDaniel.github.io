        <p>With reading any content on this webpage and related contents and whatsoever, or to which in any case i could like, content i am 
            referring to on this or any other webpage i own or know the one who knows it or im just telling to know the one who owns it, but i do
            not at all know this person or his friends or his family and neither does this person know me or my friends or my family, you agreed with 
            the terms of service and noticed that everything on this page is indeed or very well will be or could be or maybe not but who knows a lie
            and an overall product of my imagination except the parts that are not and wont ever be and cant be a lie according to our own Policy 
            (for further information on this you are welcome to contact our <a href="support.html">support</a> or query our <a href="faq.html">FAQ</a>).
            That said i think it stands out that in any case a customer wants to refer to my very own and very well written Policy
            i am capable of assuming that i've made all my points and the ones i'm going to make in any nearer or further future, also meaning the ones
            i just think of, very clear and understandable.
            It has to stand out to the reader to the one i refer to in this very moment in time, i mean obviously not in this very moment of Time
            but in the very moment of time of the time of you reading this, thats the moment of time in which it has to stand out to the reader That
            we and when i say we or to be more prezise we meaning i dont say anything because its a written text, therefore the case is that i mean  I 
            in case i wrote and definitvely not said anything as i am not any way near cabable of saying something out loud in a written text, the word we
            and therefore we assume that you agreed to all of this and are willing to give us i mean me a billion dollar just by reading any contents on this
            webpage.
