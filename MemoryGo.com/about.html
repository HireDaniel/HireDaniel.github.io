                <i>Memory Go!!!</i>
            </h2>
            <div class="desc">
            <p>the perfect tool in your memory toolbox<span class="dot">.</span></p>
            <br>
            <p>Remember it once and forever<span class="dot">...</span> such a nice slogan <span class="dot">,</span> every student hears about
                 <span class="dot">,</span> but only few so called <em>memory athletes</em>
                who charge an enourmous amount of money for books and courses and a lot of time for the training are able to use these <i>special</i> 
                techniques<span class="dot">.</span>
            </p>
            <p>   
                The idea behind <i>Memory Go</i> is to enable everyone to use the techniques of the memory masters to level up their
                memory <i>game</i> <span class="dot">,</span> wheather it<span class="dot">'</span>s for academic purposes<span class="dot">,</span> 
                for work or to expand your personal interests and capabilites <i>far beyond</i> 
                your <i>imagination</i><span class="dot">.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                Consistently used<span class="dot">,</span> these simple webpage will make your studies way easier<span class="dot">.</span> 
                Instead of remembering a boring something <span class="dot">-</span> 
                experience the images<span class="dot">,</span> locations and stories provided for <i>you</i><span class="dot">.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                As a former struggling student and a low income on<i>fail</i>ing entrepreneur i saw the benefits of being able to memorize
                every topic with ease<span class="dot">,</span> of course you need to understand it first<span class="dot">,</span> but the more 
                you know the easier it is to understand a new topic<span class="dot">.</span>  
            </p>
            <p>
                The main problem is that most people just aren<span class="dot">'</span>t able to put in the time for an effective memory routine 
                and its hard to create <i>creative</i> images of your own and build entire memory <i>palaces</i> from scratch while struggling to 
                understand a given topic<span class="dot">.</span>
            </p>
            <p>No more<span class="dot">!</span></p>
            <p>
                <i>Memory Go</i> started as help for myself<span class="dot">,</span> but has expanded into a growing community full of <i>loving</i> 
                and <i>supporting</i> people all around the <i>world</i><span class="dot">.</span>
